<p>Digital System opened my eyes. Boolean logic, digital electronics and the introduction of architecture made my eyes light up!</p>

<p>Maybe this is what will bring me lifelong satisfaction. I’m not entirely sure, but I believe it’s worth the risk. After Digital Systems II, I was supposed to wait two whole years to take Computer Architecture, but I decided to start earlier.</p>

<p>My journey begins here, with an online Computer Architecture course by Professor Onur Mutlu, which he made available on YouTube. For my course conclusion project, I choose to scale up a RISC-V processor by implementing Out-of-Order execution, Branch prediction and maybe even Cache. Let’s go!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got into university, didn’t take a long time for me to realize that I would like to work with hardware.
