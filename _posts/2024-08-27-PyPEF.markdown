### Understanding Isostatic Structures

Isostatic structures are those in which the internal forces can be determined purely through the equations of static equilibrium. This means that the structure is statically determinate, with just enough supports and members to ensure stability without any redundancy. These structures are essential in engineering because they allow for straightforward analysis, making it easier to predict how a structure will behave under various loads.

### What is [PyPEF](https://github.com/sarmentow/pypef/blob/main/README.md)?

PyPEF is a Python-based library designed specifically for describing and solving isostatic structures. Developed as part of the course PEF3208 - Fundamentals of Structural Mechanics at Poli-USP, under the guidance of Professor Guilherme Rosa Franzini, PyPEF offers a versatile and powerful toolset for engineers and researchers. 

With PyPEF, users can create interactive programs to construct and analyze isostatic structures. The library enables the calculation of internal forces, such as bending moments, shear forces, and axial forces, which are critical for ensuring the safety and performance of structures. Additionally, PyPEF allows for the testing of different materials and design scenarios, providing engineers with the flexibility to explore various design possibilities.

### Why PyPEF?

The library is built using Python, making it an ideal back-end for other applications. Structures are described using classes and objects, aligning with Python's object-oriented programming paradigm. This approach not only makes the code more intuitive and modular but also facilitates the integration of PyPEF into larger projects, where it can serve as a core component for structural analysis and design tools.

We weren’t trying to reinvent the wheel with PyPEF; rather, we focused on providing modularity and making the project enjoyable. By using PyPEF, we were able to avoid the tedious process of manually calculating complicated structures and instead had fun exploring the possibilities that the library offers.

### Conclusion

PyPEF opens up a wide range of possibilities for both educational and practical applications in the field of structural engineering. Whether you are developing a new software tool or simply exploring different structural designs, PyPEF provides a solid foundation to build upon.
