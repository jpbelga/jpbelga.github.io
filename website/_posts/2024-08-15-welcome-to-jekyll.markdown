When I got into university, didn't take a long time for me to realize that I would like to work with hardware. Having this desire does not mean that I knew, or even now know, exactly what I want to focus on. My intuition tells me that I need to pursue the desire of steer away from a trivial Software Engineer career.

Digital System opened my eyes. Boolean logic, digital electronics and the introduction of architecture made my eyes light up! 

Maybe this is what will bring me lifelong satisfaction. I'm not entirely sure, but I believe it's worth the risk. After Digital Systems II, I was supposed to wait two whole years to take Computer Architecture, but I decided to start earlier.

My journey begins here, with an online Computer Architecture course by Professor Onur Mutlu, which he made available on YouTube. For my course conclusion project, I choose to scale up a RISC-V processor by implementing Out-of-Order execution, Branch prediction and maybe even Cache. Let's go!
