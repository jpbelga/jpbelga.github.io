Let's make internet uncool again!

So what is this? This random webpage is just a safe spot were I can put down in words some thoughts and learnings. I'm not interested in teaching anything to anyone, but this is a way to share some content in the good 'n old way: with a couple of words written in an unpretentious way. More than sharing, this is a documentation project of my learnings and experiments. So, lets make internet uncool again. I'm, sure, not interested in UX/UI, beautiful buttons, nice and cosy messages that holds your attention or the stuff that made internet "cool". Let's fast forward to the past in the good way: prioritizing what is relevant. So for those who care: this is a eternal minimal page, always in construction. Built while I learn.
